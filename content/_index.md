## About Me

Hey there! :wave:

 I'm Pratik, and I'm all about the exciting world of tech, video games, art, and game development. I'm also a bit of a data geek. But, my biggest passion is creating platforms that empower and support creative individuals on their journey to success, all while making their lives a little bit easier. 
 
 I'm on a mission to make the world a better place, one of the motivations behind me building <a href="https://indiefold.com" target="_blank">IndieFold</a>, a project I proudly launched to champion and nurture creativity in the Indie game dev community. Connect with me on this adventure, where games and art meet, and together, we'll shape a brighter, more creative world.
