## Abstract

Insights and understanding of factors associated with student success is of great significance among higher education universities and the prospective student population including their parents. Prospective students are interested in learning about completion rates and their financial well-being after graduation in the form of expected earnings across universities. Various SAS® procedures in Enterprise Guide® software were used to import, merge, clean, and analyze a big dataset of universities and colleges collected by over a period of 10 years. The study uses publicly available College Scorecard data to study the factors associated with student success and financial well-being. SAS® Visual Analytics software was used in this study to visualize and present the findings of the study. In this study we find a few institutional characteristics to be strongly related to both student success and financial well-being. <a href="https://support.sas.com/resources/papers/proceedings19/4054-2019.pdf" target="_blank">Paper PDF</a>
