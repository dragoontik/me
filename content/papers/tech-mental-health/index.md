## Abstract

Understanding important motivators of health maintenance is vital in all aspects of personal, social and professional development. It is also of great interest for organizations to be cognizant of the mental healthcare needs as it has been identified as a major contributor to loss of productivity not just for the sufferer but for employers and the economy. Due to the lack of research in determining motivating factors for mental health service seeking among relatively healthy working populations, this data analysis study analyzes publicly available data from a survey of technology workers with the intent to find predictors of seeking mental health treatment. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.28234.62405" target="_blank">Read Full Paper</a>
