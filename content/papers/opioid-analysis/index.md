## Abstract

Due to two decades of rapidly increasing mortality from useof both illicit and prescription opioid drugs, a search formodifiable community and intrapersonal risk markers are ofgreat interest to public health professionals and first-responders in hopes of preventing opioid induced drugoverdose. This data analysis attempts to predict the risk ofopioid overdoses using a public dataset of overdose victimsfrom the state of Connecticut from 2012 to 2017 along withcity/town level community characteristics from the UnitedStates Census Board via Principle Component LogisticRegression.
