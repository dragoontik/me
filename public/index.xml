      <description>Abstract Understanding important motivators of health maintenance is vital in all aspects of personal, social and professional development. It is also of great interest for organizations to be cognizant of the mental healthcare needs as it has been identified as a major contributor to loss of productivity not just for the sufferer but for employers and the economy. Due to the lack of research in determining motivating factors for mental health service seeking among relatively healthy working populations, this data analysis study analyzes publicly available data from a survey of technology workers with the intent to find predictors of seeking mental health treatment.</description>

      <title>Demographic and Socioeconomic Differences between Armed and Unarmed Police Homicide Victims</title>
      <link>https://example.com/papers/police-violence-paper/</link>

      <description>Abstract In the past two years there has been a growing public and academic interest in understanding the relationship between police violence and possible racially motivated shootings of unarmed minorities by law-enforcement. Though, much research has identified and evaluated gaps in knowledge and accounting of police killings and shootings in the United States, deaths by law-enforcement personnel regardless of victim race appear to be unusually high. Reasonable justification of police lethal force is certainly warranted in situations where potential suspects clearly appear to be armed with a weapon, however, little work had been done to establish any commonality characteristics of armed suspects that law-enforcement frequently encounter.</description>

      <description>Abstract Obesity continues to be a major public health issue impacting young children who may move on to develop debilitating diseases and chronic conditions in adulthood. A great deal of research has been done to find risk factors that can be intervened upon to reduce the prevalence of obesity in young children from birth to the age of 5 or 6 which include demographic and socioeconomic variables. Multiple intervention studies also point to prenatal, and early childhood time periods as an effective place to aim obesity prevention in.</description>
